## About

This project is a smaller version of the game [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork_I).

Zork is a 1980s text adventure game developed by four members of the MIT Dynamic Modeling Group —
Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.

In the game, the player is controlled through text commands.
Their objective is to collect all the loot found in the dungeon.
